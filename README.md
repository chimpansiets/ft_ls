# ft_ls

As simple as listing the files in a directory

## Getting Started

Run my makefile by typing 'make' in a terminal in this directory. My makefile will compile a binary called
'ft_ls'. run `./ft_ls` to see the files in your current directory. You can also run it with certain flags enabled.
run `./ft_ls -help` for more info.
Or run `./ft_ls -sudoku [sudoku_file.txt]` for an amazing sudoku solver!
There is already an example sudoku in this repo called `sudoku.txt`

## Features

following flags       : -lraRt
